					vote for political parties that will opt out, switch to renewable energies, join demonstrations. But let's be

					Since you're not going to get out of your comfort zone, why don't you signup for our free notification service for when the shit really
					hits the fan? Our service is a based on gamma radiation data that is made available on the <a href="https://remap.jrc.ec.europa.eu/GammaDoseRates.aspx">
					EUropean Radiological Data Exchange Platform</a>. Don't live in the EU? Well, you're out of luck. <br><br>Despite offering the data online, the EU does not provide
					a way to notify people directly for when gamma radiation surpasses a certain
					threshhold, which is where we jump in. You don't have to wait until the nuclear power plant operators decide to give out a warning, you can
					be notified as soon as radiation levels are too high. If that happens, carefully double check the radiation map, wind direction and get the fuck out.
